My assumption is that the congestion window (CWND) graph using TCP CUBIC will not differ too much compared to a flow that uses TCP Reno, mainly because traffic is typically not too heavy in a small home network. However, I predict there the CUBIC graph will show more convex and concave sections as time increases in the simulation, but both will display sawtooth-like graphs.

The main reason for my hypothesis is that "CUBIC also behaves like Standard TCP when the cubic window growth function is slower than Standard TCP [1]". The reason why the TCP Reno, a closely related variant of TCP Standard, might display a sawtooth structure is because it "grows its window one per round trip time (RTT) [1]". This means that it will grow linearly until a dropped packet is detected, which precedes a small reset, indicated as a vertical drop on the graph. This picture in the paper shows a growth function of TCP CUBIC, which consists of both convex and concave sections. As I have predicted above, the CUBIC graph may initially have a sawtooth-like structure as well, but would eventually taper into a concave/convex curve.

The graph `small-queue_tcp_cwnd_iperf.png` has a huge initial spike, but eventually has a repetitive sawtooth pattern that fluctuates between 12 and 31 size cwnd.
